engine, being a form of a _ content Editing display showing MediaWiki markup
management system, differs from other web- language

based systems such as blog software or static

site generators, in that the content is created

without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure
to emerge according to the needs of the users.“] Wiki engines usually allow content to be
written using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text
editor.[2] There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other
software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas
others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for
example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit
access without enforcing access control. Further rules may be imposed to organize content.

There are hundreds of thousands of wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis
functioning as knowledge management resources, note-taking tools, community websites, and
intranets. Ward Cunningham, the developer of the first wiki software, WikiWikiWeb, originally
described wiki as "the simplest online database that could possibly work".[3] "Wiki"
(pronounced [wiki]!™°te 1) is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick" .[41[51[61

The online encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of
the most widely viewed sites in the world, having been ranked in the top twenty since 2007.!7]
Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one
pertaining to a specific language. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection of
articles: as of January 2024, it has over six million articles.!8]

Characteristics

In their 2001 book The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web, Ward Cunningham and co-
author Bo Leuf described the essence of the Wiki concept:l9]10]

= "A wiki invites all users—not just experts—to edit any page or to create new

pages within the wiki web site, using only a standard 'plain-vanilla' Web browser
without any extra add-ons."
